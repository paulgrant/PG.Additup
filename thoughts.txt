AJAX requests - used axios because of promises.
Coud use standard fetch and wrap in promises.

To increase the difficult we could have a user input that is then sent with the request for a new exercise.
This would affect the validation and the placeholder text on inputs.


In API consider using IActionResult as the return value from the controllers - this would enable HttpStatus codes to be sent.
